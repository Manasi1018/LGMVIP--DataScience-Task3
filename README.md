**Prediction using Decision Tree Algorithm**
Implement a Decision Tree classifier to predict the class label of new data. This project creates a Decision Tree classifier and visualizes it graphically, enabling accurate predictions for new input data.

Overview:
The Decision Tree algorithm is a powerful tool for classification tasks. This project creates a Decision Tree classifier and visualizes it to understand its decision-making process. Once trained, the classifier can accurately predict the class label of new data based on its features.
